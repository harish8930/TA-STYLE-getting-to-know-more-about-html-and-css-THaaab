        <h2>German Shepherd</h2>
        <p>They are handsome, regal, powerful, courageous, loyal, wolf-like, and intelligent. Also called Alsatians, these dogs make very fine guard dogs with their impressive personality and their unflinching loyalty towards their owner. One of the most easily recognized and one of the most popular of all breeds, they are acclaimed for their versatility.

            German Shepherds have a high tolerance against cold. However, they can also survive in hot weather, but they need additional care. Their double coat helps them cope with varied weather conditions; their inner jacket acts like insulator and keeps cold air trapped inside it in the hot season while performing opposite duty in the cold season. German Shepherds enjoy learning, so basic obedience training is excellent for them. Characterized by their great adaptability and physical prowess, German Shepherds make for one of the best foreign dog breeds suited for Indian climatic conditions</p>

            <h2> Pug </h2>
            <p>It is the smallest dog breed suitable for Indian climate. They have wrinkly faces and bulging dark eyes filled with spark. Originated in China, this breed is very good for small homes as it requires lesser space. They are friendly, cheerful, self-confident, and also a bit stubborn. Pugs make the best dog breeds in Indian climate for the cool region of India. A humid and hot environment can make them suffer heatstroke as they have a tiny nose; they are very sensitive to heat and humidity, so they need a lot of care and regular check-ups with the vet. </p>

            <h2>Indian Spitz </h2>
            <p>Indian Spitz is an attractive dog breed that needs care and pampering and has the potential to become an ideal pet. The British who began breeding them from a stock of German Spitzes introduced the Indian Spitz in India. After the years of frequent researches and breeding, the dog breed was produced that was perfect to be suited in the hot and humid climate of the plains in India. They are extremely zealous, energetic, and enthusiastic and are sometimes, even known for understanding human intentions! These traits make them an ideal choice for an Indian.</p>
